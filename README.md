We provide the code implementation based on an improved LSGAN model, which includes the encoder for encoding in the autoencoder framework, the decoder for decoding image features, the generator for generating new data samples, the discriminator for distinguishing between real and generated data, and the AMCCNet class, which integrates these components and sets the training parameters and optimizer, supporting training on GPUs. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks, this approach typically produces more stable generation quality and better results.
